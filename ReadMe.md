# Multithreaded Proxy Server

## Overview

A high-performance multithreaded proxy server implemented in C++, designed to efficiently handle concurrent network connections with advanced caching, logging, rate limiting, and load balancing capabilities. This server provides a robust solution for proxying HTTP requests with minimal overhead and maximum scalability.

## Key Features

- **Multithreaded** Architecture: Leverages a sophisticated thread pool to manage multiple client connections concurrently, ensuring optimal resource utilization and responsive performance.

- **Intelligent Caching**: Implements a Least Recently Used (LRU) caching mechanism to store and retrieve HTTP responses, dramatically reducing redundant backend requests and improving response times.

- **Comprehensive Logging**: Integrates a flexible, custom logging system that provides granular tracking of HTTP request and response metadata for comprehensive monitoring and debugging.

- **Rate Limiting**: Implements advanced rate limiting mechanisms to control the number of requests a client can make within a specified time window, preventing abuse and ensuring fair resource distribution.

- **Load Balancing**: Provides load balancing capabilities to distribute client requests across multiple backend servers, ensuring high availability and improved fault tolerance.

- **Lightweight Design**: Operates without external database dependencies, ensuring a lean, high-performance proxy solution that can be easily integrated into various network architectures.



## Technology Stack

- **Language**: C++ (Modern C++ standards)
- **Build System**: CMake
- **Concurrency**: Thread Pool design pattern
- **Caching**: Custom LRU Cache implementation
- **Logging**: Utilizes spdlog and fmt libraries
- **Rate Limiting**: Custom rate limiting implementation for HTTP requests
- **Load Balancing**: Round-robin load balancing for distributing traffic across backend server

## Prerequisites

- **Compiler**: Modern C++ compiler (g++ â‰¥ 9.0 or clang++)
- **Build Tools**: 
  - **CMake** (version 3.10 or later)
  - **pthread** library
- **Dependencies**:
  - `spdlog`
  - `fmt`

## Installation

### Build Instructions

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multithreaded-proxy-server.git
cd multithreaded-proxy-server

# Create build directory
mkdir build && cd build

# Configure the project
cmake ..

# Compile the server
make
```

### Running the Server

```bash
# Execute the proxy server
./server
```

## Usage Scenario

The proxy server acts as an intermediary for HTTP requests, efficiently:

- Forwarding client requests to backend servers
- Caching responses to minimize network overhead
- Logging detailed request/response information
- Enforcing rate limiting to control traffic and ensure fair use of resources
- Balancing load across backend servers for improved scalability and fault tolerance

## Roadmap and Improvements

Below are the enhancements planned for future releases to improve the functionality, scalability, and security of the proxy server:

### 1. **SSL/TLS Encryption Support**
   - **Description**: Implement SSL/TLS encryption to secure communications between clients and the proxy server.
   - **Benefit**: Provides encryption for data in transit, ensuring privacy and security.

### 2. **Advanced Caching Mechanisms**
   - **Description**: Integrate more advanced caching mechanisms such as Redis or Memcached for distributed caching.
   - **Benefit**: Scales caching across multiple servers, improving performance and reducing database load.

### 3. **Distributed Proxy Server**
   - **Description**: Set up a load-balanced cluster of proxy servers to distribute traffic across multiple instances.
   - **Benefit**: Ensures high availability, better fault tolerance, and improved scalability.


### 6. **Request/Response Compression**
   - **Description**: Add support for HTTP compression (gzip or Brotli) for responses to reduce bandwidth consumption.
   - **Benefit**: Speeds up response times and reduces the amount of data transferred.


### 8. **HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 Support**
   - **Description**: Implement support for HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 to optimize network performance through multiplexing and header compression.
   - **Benefit**: Provides faster and more efficient handling of requests, especially for modern web applications.

### 9. **Failover and Recovery Mechanism**
   - **Description**: Implement automatic failover mechanisms, including health checks and redundancy.
   - **Benefit**: Increases reliability by ensuring minimal downtime and automatic recovery in case of failure.

### 10. **Dynamic Configuration Management**
   - **Description**: Allow dynamic configuration updates (e.g., routes, caching policies) without requiring server restarts.
   - **Benefit**: Makes the proxy server more flexible and easier to manage in a production environment.


### 12. **Traffic Analytics**
   - **Description**: Integrate traffic analytics to gather data on request/response patterns and usage statistics.
   - **Benefit**: Helps make data-driven decisions on performance tuning, capacity planning, and optimization.
