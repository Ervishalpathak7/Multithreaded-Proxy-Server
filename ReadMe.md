# Multithreaded Proxy Server

## Overview

A high-performance multithreaded proxy server implemented in C++, designed to efficiently handle concurrent network connections with advanced caching, logging, rate limiting, and load balancing capabilities. This server provides a robust solution for proxying HTTP requests with minimal overhead and maximum scalability.

## Key Features

- **Multithreaded** Architecture: Leverages a sophisticated thread pool to manage multiple client connections concurrently, ensuring optimal resource utilization and responsive performance.

- **Intelligent Caching**: Implements a Least Recently Used (LRU) caching mechanism to store and retrieve HTTP responses, dramatically reducing redundant backend requests and improving response times.

- **Comprehensive Logging**: Integrates a flexible, custom logging system that provides granular tracking of HTTP request and response metadata for comprehensive monitoring and debugging.

- **Rate Limiting**: Implements advanced rate limiting mechanisms to control the number of requests a client can make within a specified time window, preventing abuse and ensuring fair resource distribution.

- **Load Balancing**: Provides load balancing capabilities to distribute client requests across multiple backend servers, ensuring high availability and improved fault tolerance.

- **Lightweight Design**: Operates without external database dependencies, ensuring a lean, high-performance proxy solution that can be easily integrated into various network architectures.



## Technology Stack

- **Language**: C++ (Modern C++ standards)
- **Build System**: CMake
- **Concurrency**: Thread Pool design pattern
- **Caching**: Custom LRU Cache implementation
- **Logging**: Utilizes spdlog and fmt libraries
- **Rate Limiting**: Custom rate limiting implementation for HTTP requests
- **Load Balancing**: Round-robin load balancing for distributing traffic across backend server

## Prerequisites

- **Compiler**: Modern C++ compiler (g++ â‰¥ 9.0 or clang++)
- **Build Tools**: 
  - **CMake** (version 3.10 or later)
  - **pthread** library
- **Dependencies**:
  - `spdlog`
  - `fmt`

## Installation

### Build Instructions

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multithreaded-proxy-server.git
cd multithreaded-proxy-server

# Create build directory
mkdir build && cd build

# Configure the project
cmake ..

# Compile the server
make
```

### Running the Server

```bash
# Execute the proxy server
./server
```

## Usage Scenario

The proxy server acts as an intermediary for HTTP requests, efficiently:

- Forwarding client requests to backend servers
- Caching responses to minimize network overhead
- Logging detailed request/response information
- Enforcing rate limiting to control traffic and ensure fair use of resources
- Balancing load across backend servers for improved scalability and fault tolerance

## Roadmap and Improvements

- **Enhanced Security**: Implement SSL/TLS encryption support
- **Traffic Management**: Add rate limiting mechanisms
- **Performance Optimization**: Develop advanced caching strategies
